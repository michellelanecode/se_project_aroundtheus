# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview
Hello! This is a web app called Around the U.S.
This is the 3rd project created for the software engineering program with Practicum by Yandex.

I've used HTML and CSS to structure and style the webpage and I've used JavaScript to make the page interactive.

Currently users are able to update their profile name and like/unlike any of the profile photos. More functionality will be coming soon!
