building = bundling a projects files and dependences and connecting
them to HTML

takes new js code and makes it compatible with all browsers
stylesheets are minified to increase load time
vendor prefixes are set automatically so it doesnt
have to be added to css

bundlers are Gulp, Webpack and Grunt

NPM allows devs to install tools and libaries in their projects easily
can be used to publish, discover, install and create new programs

libaries and tools are considered dependencies

package.json holds the information about tools and libaries

the package-lock json file holds dependency version information so that if someone else
accesses your project they are sure to download the same dependency.

dev packages have two categories

1. whats needed in final build
2. packages needed while developing the project

dependecies will be in the final build
devDependenices will be omitted.

There can be several builds in a project serving a different purpose.

Standard: 2 builds one for development and another for production.
One for development and One for Production

OldSyntax and vendor prefixes are needed for production build but not dev
Weback needed for dev build but not production

Scripts are webpack commands
can run a script but using npm run name of script
